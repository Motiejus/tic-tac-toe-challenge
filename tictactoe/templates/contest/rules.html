<h1>What are the rules?</h1>

We have a “big” tic-tac-toe board with a “small” tic-tac-toe board in each
cell. Your goal is to win the big board by winning small ones.

You may only play in the big field that corresponds to the last small field
your opponent played. When you are sent to a field that is already
won/lost/draw, you can place the move wherever you like.

For example, here is a game where O wins, because X makes an error:

<div>
<div style="width: 70%; float: left;">
  <div class="board_here"></div>
  <button id="reset">&lt;&lt;</button>
  <button id="backward">&lt;</button>
  <button id="forward">&gt;</button>
  <button id="fastforward">&gt;&gt;</button>
</div>
<div class="status_here" style="width: 30%; float: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both"></div>
</div>

<h1>What should I deliver?</h1>

You write a Lua function that takes 4 arguments (xo, board, row, col) and
returns the coordinates of where to place your move. You can find an example
solution in the <a
href="https://github.com/Motiejus/tictactoelib/blob/master/tictactoelib/examples/dumb_player.lua">tictactoe
library repository</a>. This example is what you are competing against;
if you win, you get a cap!

<h1>What if I cheat?</h1>

Since all the activities are logged, and the contest is quite small, we’ll most
likely discover your cheating. This will, without exception, spell misery for
you, your family, your friends, and your pets, from the moment of your
discovery until the moment of your demise. In short: don’t cheat. You don’t
want to cheat.  However, if you feel like doing systems penetration or enjoy
hacking systems, we have something for you too!

<p/>
If you manage to get out of the sandbox, irrecoverably bring down the system,
read others’ code or influence the result unfairly, we’ll award you with
another Spil Games cap. Since this is not meant to be a security contest (the
prizes would be much better if it were), a hostile environment is available for
scratching your itch if you have one, and earning an extra cap for doing so.
The environment is here: http://hostile.tictactoe.spilgames.com/

<p/>
If you achieve this successfully you qualify for a ‘penetration prize’. Just
make sure you report your achievement and your method to
motiejus.jakstys@spilgames.com.

<p/>
Be friendly to others, and good luck coding! :-)
